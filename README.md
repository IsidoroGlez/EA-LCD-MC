# Monte Carlo Simulations of the 3D Edwards–Anderson Spin Glass in Tubular Geometry

This repository contains the code, processed data, and analysis tools used to perform **Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Edwards–Anderson spin glass model** in a tubular geometry with both **periodic and open boundary conditions** along the longitudinal \(Z\) direction, using CUDA-C.

The simulations and the resulting data, figures, and tables correspond to the study presented in [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07926)

## What this project does

- Implements Monte Carlo simulations of the **3D Edwards–Anderson spin glass model** in a tubular geometry.
- Supports **periodic (PBC)** and **open (OBC)** boundary conditions along the longitudinal \(Z\) axis.
- Uses a combination of:
  - The **Metropolis algorithm**,
  - **Parallel Tempering**,
  - An optional **cluster algorithm based on Houdayer clusters**.
- Generates spin configurations that are analyzed to obtain physical observables and correlation functions.

Implementation details, compilation instructions, and execution options are described in `PROGRAM/README.md`.

## Data, figures, and tables

- The **DATA/** directory contains the processed data obtained from the analysis of the configurations generated by the simulation code.
- These data form the basis of the results presented in the associated publication.
- The **FIGURES_AND_TABLES/** directory contains the figures and tables included in the article and Supplementary Material, together with the scripts used to generate them from the processed data.

Additional information is provided in the corresponding `README.md` files within each directory.
